    A prompt is a guide for OpenAI models to generate text. It is a
    string that is used to seed the model's text generation. It is
    typically a question or a statement that the model is asked to
    respond to.

    Examples refer to "user" messages that are sent to the model, and
    "assistant" messages that are sent from the model. We use this
    as additional context for the model to generate text.
